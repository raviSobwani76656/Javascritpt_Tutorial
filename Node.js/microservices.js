/*üìò **Microservices in Node.js**

---

### üß© **1. What Are Microservices?**

Microservices are a software architecture style where an application is divided into small, independent services that communicate with each other.
Each service focuses on a specific functionality, such as authentication, payments, or orders.

**Example:**

* `Auth Service` ‚Üí Handles user login/signup
* `Order Service` ‚Üí Manages orders
* `Payment Service` ‚Üí Handles payment processing

Each of these can be built, deployed, and scaled **independently**.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **2. Why Use Microservices?**

**Advantages:**

* ‚úÖ Independent development and deployment
* ‚úÖ Easier scaling (scale only the needed service)
* ‚úÖ Technology flexibility (each service can use a different stack)
* ‚úÖ Fault isolation (one service failure doesn‚Äôt crash the entire app)
* ‚úÖ Easier to maintain and test

**Disadvantages:**

* ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex setup and communication
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires service discovery and centralized logging
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Data consistency challenges

---

### üîó **3. Communication Between Microservices**

There are **two main types** of communication:

1. **Synchronous (Direct Communication)**

   * Services communicate directly using HTTP or gRPC.
   * Example: `Order Service ‚Üí Payment Service (via REST API)`

   ```js
   // Example using Axios in Node.js
   const axios = require("axios");

   async function processPayment(orderId) {
     const response = await axios.post("http://payment-service/pay", { orderId });
     return response.data;
   }
   ```

2. **Asynchronous (Message-Based)**

   * Services communicate using a **message broker** like RabbitMQ, Kafka, or AWS SQS.
   * Ideal for decoupling and event-driven systems.

   ```js
   // Example using RabbitMQ
   const amqp = require("amqplib");

   async function publishOrder(order) {
     const connection = await amqp.connect("amqp://localhost");
     const channel = await connection.createChannel();
     await channel.assertQueue("orderQueue");
     channel.sendToQueue("orderQueue", Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(order)));
   }
   ```

### üß± **4. Core Building Blocks of Microservices**

1. **API Gateway** ‚Äì Entry point for clients. Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting.
   Example: Kong, Nginx, or Express Gateway.

2. **Service Registry** ‚Äì Keeps track of available services and their locations.
   Example: Eureka, Consul, or etcd.

3. **Message Broker** ‚Äì Enables asynchronous communication between services.
   Example: RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis Pub/Sub.

4. **Database per Service** ‚Äì Each service has its own database to maintain data autonomy.
   Example:

   * Auth Service ‚Üí MongoDB
   * Order Service ‚Üí PostgreSQL
   * Payment Service ‚Üí MySQL

### üß© **6. Implementing Microservices in Node.js**

You can use **Express.js** or **Fastify** for each microservice.

**Example: Order Service**

```js
// order-service/server.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/order", (req, res) => {
  const { userId, productId } = req.body;
  // process order
  res.json({ success: true, message: "Order placed successfully" });
});

app.listen(4000, () => console.log("Order Service running on port 4000"));
```

**Example: Payment Service**

```js
// payment-service/server.js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/pay", (req, res) => {
  const { orderId } = req.body;
  // process payment logic
  res.json({ success: true, message: "Payment successful" });
});

app.listen(5000, () => console.log("Payment Service running on port 5000"));
```

### üß∞ **7. Common Tools and Libraries**

| Functionality      | Tools/Libraries              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| HTTP Communication | Axios, Node Fetch            |
| Message Broker     | RabbitMQ, Kafka, Redis       |
| API Gateway        | Express Gateway, Nginx, Kong |
| Service Registry   | Consul, etcd, Eureka         |
| Monitoring         | Prometheus, Grafana          |
| Logging            | Winston, Morgan, ELK Stack   |

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª **8. Data Consistency in Microservices**

Since each service has its own database, maintaining data consistency is crucial.

Common patterns:

* **SAGA Pattern:** Sequence of local transactions with compensation steps if one fails.
* **Event Sourcing:** State changes are stored as events.
* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separate read and write databases for performance and clarity.

---

### üß± **9. Deployment and Scaling**

* Use **Docker** to containerize each service.
* Orchestrate using **Kubernetes**.
* Use **PM2** for process management.

Example Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 4000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

---

### üîê **10. Security in Microservices**

* Use **JWT** for authentication.
* Always validate tokens in each microservice.
* Implement **rate limiting** and **CORS**.
* Use HTTPS in production.

---

### üß† **11. When to Use Microservices**

Use microservices when:

* Your app is large and growing fast.
* Teams are working on separate modules.
* You need scalability and fault tolerance.

Avoid microservices when:

* The project is small or has a simple scope.
* The team is inexperienced with distributed systems.

### üöÄ **12. Summary**

| Feature         | Microservices | Monolithic     |
| --------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| Scalability     | High          | Limited        |
| Deployment      | Independent   | All together   |
| Fault Isolation | Strong        | Weak           |
| Communication   | API/Event     | Function calls |
| Complexity      | High          | Low            |

‚úÖ **Key Takeaway:**
Microservices in Node.js provide scalability, modularity, and independent deployment.
However, they require strong planning around communication, security, monitoring, and data consistency.
